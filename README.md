# Pazzwordz
A password manager that uses MySQL database to store information. 

The program is written in python and uses 3 modules which are random, mysql.connector, and sys. The program gives user the option to pick from one of the 4 options
given at the main menu. The screenshots show how the user can work with the database by giving basic input in the terminal/UNIX. 

As an additional function, a random password generator was also added to the password manager to give users some ideas if they can't think of any password. 

Below is an image of the program:
